# Established Source Generator, v1.0

This project is provided for portfolio review only. No permission is granted for reuse, modification, or redistribution.

OVERVIEW

The Established Source Generator is a cross‑platform utility that creates a complete snapshot of a project directory and stores it in a single manifest file. The tool can then reconstruct the entire directory structure deterministically, making it ideal for AI context ingestion, debugging, and reproducible development workflows.

This project demonstrates:
- filesystem traversal
- deterministic rebuild logic
- manifest‑based project reconstruction
- cross‑platform scripting
- developer tooling design

KEY FEATURES

- Full project snapshotting — captures directory structure and file contents
- Deterministic reconstruction — rebuilds projects exactly as they were
- Cross‑platform support — works on Windows and Linux
- Single‑file manifest — easy to store, share, or feed into AI systems
- Safe and reversible — no destructive operations

PURPOSE

This tool was built to support AI‑assisted debugging and analysis by enabling large projects to be flattened into a single file. It also serves as a demonstration of systems thinking, automation, and developer tooling design.
